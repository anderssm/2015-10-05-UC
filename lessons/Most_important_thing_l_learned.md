## The most important thing I learned at the SWC U of C Workshop was:
 I learned that code needs to have assertions, and documentation for you to even start trusting it, and that good code had many checks. 
This lesson is important for science experiments in general. 
Also, I had never heard about Git and Version Control, and it's cool and useful. 

Thanks for the workshop and sharing!
